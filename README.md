# Dalton-s-Apartment_Maze
This is a 3D VR Maze I created using Unity. It has an obstacle, you'll need to get by with a key and some dead ends you have to retract to. Let's see if you can figure it out.

Interactions: You have to use the controllers aim to to hover. You can teleport with locomotion using "trigger" button. And The key is grabble with the "grip" button on the controller! You will see a "You win" when you completed the Maze! 

Thank you for playing!
